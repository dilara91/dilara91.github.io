I am third year PhD student at School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh in Scotland, UK. My research interests are privacy on social media, computational social science, human computer interaction, natural language processing. I am working on privacy in social media, especially unintended disclosures and user understanding of privacy controls. I have a [blog](https://medium.com/@dilarakkl) where I relay my experiences doing PhD in Edinburgh, written in Turkish.


I received my undergradute degree in 2015, masters degree in 2017 from Boğaziçi University in Turkey. My master thesis was about preserving privacy in online social networks. The [paper](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2970035)
and the [code](https://github.com/mas-boun/prinego) are available. We proposed and implemented different negotiation
techniques before uploading a post to OSNs so that every party involved is comfortable with the result.
You can have more information about the project 
[here](http://mas.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/ontology-based-privacy-management-for-social-software/prinego-privacy-negotiation/).

I worked as software engineer at [Pointr](http://www.pointrlabs.com) for 1.5 years where we tackled the indoor navigation problem.
As it is known, GPS does not work very well in indoor spaces. We use bluetooth low energy technology
to pinpoint the user's position and navigate them to their destination. This is especially useful
in places like airports and big malls. I worked with clients such as
[Gatwick Airport](https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/25/gatwick-airport-now-has-2000-beacons-for-indoor-navigation/) and
[Harrods](https://www.standard.co.uk/shopping/can-t-find-prada-then-use-the-harrods-sat-nav-a3422056.html).

My personal interests include learning new languages, cooking different cuisines, watching grandslam tennis, and reading fiction.
I studied Japanese for five years and have acquired N2 in JLPT(Japanese Language Proficiency Test). I also studied abroad for one semester
at Hanyang University in Seoul.
